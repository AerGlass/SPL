# SPL
spl is terrible and barely complete (slowest) interpreted programming language based upon the spanish language<br>
to run a app you need to modify the program tho<br>
when i say the slowest is because:<br>
1. the code is not great<br>
2. it uses python and you know, python is already slow<br>
